          <h3>Psychological assessment & testing</h3>
          <p>Testing services are available for ages 6 through adulthood. Comprehensive assessment report and feedback meetings with recommendations are provided soon after testing, in addition to communication with schools and/or other treatment providers if requested.</p>
          <p>I am warm, collaborative, and a fierce advocate for you and/or your child if needed. If you are unsure of what kind of testing you need for yourself or your child, we will work together to clarify your concerns to determine the appropriate assessment battery.</p>

          <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
          <p>I work from an integrative perspective, rooted in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (especially Schema Therapy and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and Attachment Theory. Treatment goals are collaboratively set with options for short-term or long-term therapy. As a therapist, I am authentic, warm, collaborative, and can gently confront if needed. Treatment modalities include individual child (age 4 and up), adolescent, and adult therapy, dyadic parent-child therapy, family therapy, and couples therapy.</p>
